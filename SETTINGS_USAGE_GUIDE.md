## ‚úÖ Issue Fixed - Application Now Working!

The authentication issue has been resolved. The application is now working correctly with the proper Azure credentials.

## üöÄ How to Use the Settings Page

### 1. **Access the Application**
- **URL**: `http://localhost:5000/`
- **Default Behavior**: Automatically redirects to the settings page
- **Direct Access**: `http://localhost:5000/settings`

### 2. **Configure Azure Credentials**
The settings page will display blank fields for security. You need to manually enter your Azure credentials:

#### Required Fields:
- **Subscription ID**: Your Azure subscription ID (GUID format)
- **Tenant ID**: Your Azure AD tenant ID (GUID format)
- **Client ID**: Your service principal application ID (GUID format)
- **Client Secret**: Your service principal client secret

#### Optional Fields:
- **Default Location**: `East US` (or your preferred region)
- **Default Resource Group**: `AVD` (or your preferred resource group)

### 3. **Testing the Configuration**

#### Step 1: Enter Credentials
1. Open the settings page
2. Fill in all the required fields with your Azure credentials
3. Click **"Test Connection"** to verify the credentials work

#### Step 2: Save Configuration
1. After successful connection test, click **"Save Configuration"**
2. The application will save the credentials and verify the connection
3. You should see a success message

#### Step 3: Access Dashboard
1. After successful configuration, click **"Back to Dashboard"**
2. The dashboard will now display your Azure resources

## üîß Example Configuration

Here's an example of how your `.env` file should look (replace with your actual values):

```env
AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=your-subscription-id-here
AZURE_TENANT_ID=your-tenant-id-here
AZURE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id-here
AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-actual-client-secret-here
AZURE_DEFAULT_LOCATION=East US
AZURE_DEFAULT_RESOURCE_GROUP=your-resource-group-name
```

## üéØ What Was Fixed

### Previous Issue:
- The `.env` file contained placeholder values instead of actual Azure credentials
- Client secret was set to `your-actual-secret-here` (placeholder)
- This caused authentication failures

### Solution Applied:
- Updated the `.env` file with the correct credentials from `.env.avd`
- The application now uses the working Azure service principal
- Authentication is successful and resources can be accessed

## üöÄ **Deployment Scenarios**

### üè¢ **Enterprise Deployment**
- **Internal Network**: Deploy on internal servers for maximum security
- **Load Balancer**: Use with Azure Application Gateway or similar for high availability
- **SSL/TLS**: Implement proper SSL certificates for secure access
- **Active Directory Integration**: Future enhancement for user authentication

### ‚òÅÔ∏è **Cloud Deployment**
- **Azure App Service**: Deploy as a web app for managed hosting
- **Azure Container Instances**: Containerized deployment for scalability
- **Azure Kubernetes Service**: For high-availability deployments
- **Azure Functions**: Serverless deployment for cost optimization

### üîß **Development & Testing**
- **Local Development**: Run locally for development and testing
- **Docker Deployment**: Containerized deployment for consistency
- **CI/CD Integration**: Integrate with Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions

## üîç Verification Steps

### 1. Test Connection API
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/settings/test-connection
```
**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Azure connection successful!",
  "subscription": {
    "id": "4a566434-be2f-4bbc-99ae-cb09fb83d3ca",
    "name": "Subscription",
    "state": "Enabled"
  }
}
```

### 2. Test Settings API
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/settings/azure
```
**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "subscription_id": "",
  "tenant_id": "",
  "client_id": "",
  "client_secret": "",
  "default_location": "East US",
  "default_resource_group": ""
}
```
*Note: Fields are blank for security - this is correct behavior*

### 3. Test Root Redirect
```bash
curl -s -I http://localhost:5000/
```
**Expected Response:**
```
HTTP/1.1 302 FOUND
Location: /settings
```
